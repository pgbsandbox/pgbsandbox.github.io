<hr width="60%" class="fancy-rule" /><div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Maps assemble topics for publishing.</p>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Topics as Lego pieces</h2>
      
      <p class="p">Your topics are very much like Lego pieces that can be assembled in whatever combination
    required to create the final, published output needed.</p>

      <p class="p">The topics that you and others write are assembled using a map. An advanced writer uses a map
    to pull together topics in a specific order and hierarchy and then publish to HTML, PDF, and any
    other required output.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Publishing process</h2>
      
      <p class="p">The publishing process uses the content with your markup (the sections you put your content
    into) plus the underlying architecture to generate smart output, where formatting is applied
    automatically and systematically.</p>

      <p class="p">For example, content in a Note section has text and an iconÂ  added automatically,
    without authors ever having to place it there.</p>

      <div class="fig figborder"><span class="figcap">Figure 1. A published note</span>
        
        <img class="image" id="concept_ux4_fxm_ls__image_ann_nzm_ls" src="tip.png" />
      </div>

      <p class="p">Similarly, the writer never has to set the font type, size, or any other formatting details of
    the content. The automated publishing reads what kind of section was used and formats all
    sections of the same kind (all Notes, for example) the same way. </p>

      <div class="p">The automated publishing also automatically generates items that waste a lot of time in
    traditional publishing, including<ul class="ul" id="concept_ux4_fxm_ls__ul_pbf_f1n_ls">
          <li class="li">table of contents</li>

          <li class="li">volume, section, chapter, and page numbering</li>

          <li class="li">page breaks and margins</li>

          <li class="li">headers and footers</li>

          <li class="li">index</li>

          <li class="li">list of figures</li>

          <li class="li">list of tables</li>

        </ul>
</div>

      <p class="p">The people in charge of publishing can turn on and off the objects they want generated. They
    can also format them differently for different published files; for example, they can generate a
    Table of Contents for PDFs but make it collapsible navigation tabs in HTML.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Benefits of automated formatting</h2>
      
      <div class="p">The key benefits of automated formatting using semantic markup include<ul class="ul" id="concept_ux4_fxm_ls__ul_yxv_yzm_ls">
          <li class="li">creating a consistent look and feel across all content and all writers</li>

          <li class="li">saving time and effort usually spent formatting, and</li>

          <li class="li">focusing on the content and the markup.</li>

        </ul>
</div>

      <p class="p">This separation between content and formatting also means that the source content can be used
    to generate many formats at once. The content you write in AuthorBridge could end up in PDF,
    HTML5, ePub, iOS apps, Online Help, or any other formats your readers may need. The formatting
    will look correct in all those outputs without you ever having to re-work the source
    content.</p>

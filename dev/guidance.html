<hr width="60%" class="fancy-rule" /><div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The <span class="ph uicontrol">Guidance</span> panel along the left-hand side of the window guides
  you through the content creation process.</p>

    <div class="section" id="concept_pdd_vgl_xt__section_ybb_wpl_xt"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Purpose</h2>
      
      <p class="p">The <span class="ph uicontrol">Guidance</span> panel shows you the parts of the topic that you might
    already have or might want to add. It varies depending on the topic type. It guides you by
    letting you see the parts that are required and optional for that topic type. More importantly,
    it tells you the order in which those parts must appear. Authors must respect the order of the
    parts, as they cannot be changed. This promotes consistency between topics.</p>

      <div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> Before you start writing, familiarize yourself with the parts of each topic type
    to get familiar with the optional and required parts. You can plan your content better once you
    know what the topics need to be complete. Only a few parts are required, like the title. If you like, you may remove
    any parts you don't need, though leaving empty parts is perfectly fine.</div>

    <div class="section" id="concept_pdd_vgl_xt__section_ifs_frl_xt"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Functionality</h2>
      
      <div class="p">The <span class="ph uicontrol">Guidance</span> panel has functionality to further guide you in content
     creation:<ul class="ul" id="concept_pdd_vgl_xt__ul_v3w_krl_xt">
          <li class="li">Hover help: Each part has hover help that describes the part and tells you when you might
      find it useful.</li>

          <li class="li">Add or remove parts, depending on the icon:<ul class="ul" id="concept_pdd_vgl_xt__ul_gkb_tql_xt">
              <li class="li">Plus: Optional part that you can add.</li>

              <li class="li">X: Optional part that you are currently using but can removed. To be able to remove it, it
        must have no content (text written in that part).</li>

              <li class="li" id="concept_pdd_vgl_xt__li_kmj_nw2_25">*: A required part. For example, every step must have an instruction
        part.</li>

              <li class="li">Check mark: You have content in that part, either by default when you created a new topic
        or because you typed it in.</li>

            <p class="p">The primary reason a reader accesses documentation is to get help figuring out how to
                use the product. The reader has a problem with the product, they spend a minute or
                two trying to figure it out on their own, and then they try the documentation. If
                the documentation provides answers, then it is useful and usable. The key is to
                identify how your readers use your product so you can anticipate the help they
                need.</p>

                    reader might perform.</span>
                <div class="itemgroup stepxmp">For example, if the product functionality is creating reports, then
                    business goals could include:<ul class="ul" id="task_k1w_p1k_ks__ul_dy5_5nj_ks">
                        <li class="li">Create line-of-business reports</li>

                <div class="itemgroup info">For example, if an interface page has a series of options, put those options
                    and their brief descriptions in a reference topic. If they need longer

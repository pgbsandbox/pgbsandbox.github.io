   <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Conditions</h2>
    <p class="p">Conditions come in logical groups. For example, text may be made conditional for a particular version of a product. We may have conditional content that just applies to version 2 of the product. Or, certain text may only apply to the premium packaging of the product. There may be several packages: standard, premium, ultimate. We see that conditions do come in groups, such as <em class="ph i">version</em> and <em class="ph i">package</em>, and that each condition group has its own allowable values.</p>


    <p class="p">Currently, AuthorBridge supports viewing conditions applied to text, but it does not support applying conditions to text. Use the <span class="ph uicontrol">Conditions</span> menu panel to access information about the currently applied conditions. You may choose whether or not to have conditions displayed in color.</p>


    <p class="p">You may also turn conditions on or off. If a condition is off, it will be filtered from the view. For example, if you turn off the condition for version 2 of a product, then text that applies to version 2 will no longer be visible.</p>


    <p class="p">Sometimes conditions are used in combinations. AuthorBridge will choose a unique color for each such combination that exists in a topic. When this happens, the various condition combinations will be shown below a line that separates them from the base conditions. You can only turn base conditions on and off. The combinations will react accordingly.</p>


    <p class="p">If the color schem doesn't work well for you, let AuthorBridge compute a new set of colors for you. All you have to do is provide a new name for the color scheme. The same color scheme name will always produce the same colors for a particular set of conditions.</p>

        <div class="section context">
            <p class="p">One of the advantages of using AuthorBridge over a word processing tool like
                Microsoft Word is that you are using sections to indicate the type of content
                included therein. This is called semantic markup. </p>

            <p class="p">Semantic markup gives the content incredible versatility, especially during the
                publishing process. Conversely, content that is in the wrong section (a section that
                doesn't match the actual content) can often become a problem during publishing.</p>

            <p class="p">For example, you put things that a user needs to do before they begin a task in a
                section called <em class="ph i">Before you begin</em> rather than any other section. Inversely, you
                would never put any other kind of information in the <em class="ph i">Before you begin</em>
                section, even if it looks like a good location for it.</p>

            <p class="p">Your publishing process might automatically add the word <em class="ph i">Prerequisite</em> before
                the text of any <em class="ph i">Before you begin</em> section. If you have content that is
                    <em class="ph i">not</em> a prerequisite in <em class="ph i">Before you begin</em>, then the result confuses
                readers.</p>

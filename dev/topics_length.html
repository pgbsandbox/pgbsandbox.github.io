   <p class="p">A topic, if you were to print it out, would be about a half page long. Sometimes, a topic is
    slightly shorter or longer but half a page is an ideal length.</p>

   <p class="p">Each topic has a very specific purpose: to inform on a very specific subject. If your topic is
    longer, then it likely isn't serving its purpose and your reader won't find it helpful.</p>

   <p class="p">Always err on the side of too short rather than too long.</p>

  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">How do you know a topic is too long?</h2>
   
   <div class="p">Generally speaking, you can use these tips to gauge whether you have put too much information
    in one topic and need to split it into multiple topics, each with a slightly different focus.
    Any one of these rules means that your topic needs to be chunked a little bit more.<ul class="ul" id="concept_esn_2ll_3s__ul_a3y_mll_3s">

            you can create a link between them. It is possible to link between topics that are not

            <p class="p">A link from one topic to another lets you connect information from one topic to
                another. This, in turns, lets a reader find associated information without
            overloading any one particular topic with too much information. While you can link to any element of the target topic, it is generally best to link to the whole topic, or to something inside that has a title of caption, such as a table or figure. When doing so, link to the main structure, not to its title or caption.</p>

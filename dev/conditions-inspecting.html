      <p class="p">The active conditions at any given point are accumulated from their surrounding context. If a paragraph has applied conditions, and inside this paragraph a phrase has conditions, then all of these conditions apply to the text in the phrase. It is even possible to set conditions on an entire topic. AuthorBridge allows you to quickly find out what conditions are applied locally at any point of interest and all the conditions that have been set on the surrounding content.</p>
